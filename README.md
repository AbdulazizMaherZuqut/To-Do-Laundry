# To-Do-Laundry
My graduation project is a web based for washing and
ironing clothes, and the site offers many types of clothes for ironing and washing.
It offers urgent service as well as delivery, and payment when receiving. And I
built it from scratch. Also, I used PHP for back-end. HTML, CSS, and bootstrap
for front-end. And used the database MySQL.
